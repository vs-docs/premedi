## **How to Upgrade** {#how-to-upgrade}

If you have purchased an earlier version and want to upgrade your website to the newwer version of this template, You can follow the steps. In each update, we will keep a changelog or version history, where we will keep the log of all changes made. We will list out the Changes made, Features added and Pages modified. So it will be easier for you to replace the existing. If you have modified a file which has latest update, for example, CSS, Open both page in a code editor and use a Comparison Sofware or an Online Tool like [Diff Now](http://diffnow.com) to compare changes in both files. Then you can manually copy paste the changed lines without affecting your file. NOTE: We recommend that you keep a separate file for new additions or changes if possible.
