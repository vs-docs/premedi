# Support



Please remember you have purchased a very affordable template and you have not paid for a full-time web design agency. Occasionally we will help with small tweaks, but these requests will be put on a lower priority due to their nature. Please be patient, polite and respectful. We will try to answer your questions as soon as possible

###  **Before seeking support, please...** {#before-seeking-support-please}

1. Make sure your question is a valid issue and not a customization request.
2. Make sure you have read through the documentation and any related guides before asking support on how to accomplish a task.
3. Make sure to read existing support questions by other users.
4. Almost 80% of the time we find that the solution to an issues can be solved with a simple "Google Search". You might want to try that before seeking support. You might be able to fix the issue yourself much quicker than we can respond to your request.
