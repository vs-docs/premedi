 If you are able to read this documentation locally, which means you have successfully downloaded the package and extracted the zip. The file structure as follows :

```text

│   │   ├── plugins/
│   │   ├── themes/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/

│   │   ├── ie/
│   │   ├── includes/
│   │   ├── plugins/
│   ├── php/
│   ├── video/
```

The folder you have to customize is the HTML folder. Copy `HTML` folder from the package and paste it in your Project Folder. \(This helps you to prevent overwriting in original files. so if you messed up something, you will get the original here.\)
